1.0: First version.
1.0a: Changed parameters for bypassing prechecks to allow bypassing
	the signify binary executable check first.
1.0b: Added another check on verify_gzip for require_public_key_file so
	it's not a no-op when skip_checks is used.
1.0c: Improved verify error handling so /bin/sh doesn't have to be unveiled
	and for consistency between verify and verify_gzip.
1.0d: Use signify-openbsd when running on Linux.
1.0e: Be less strict on key dir since OpenBSD 7.8 doesn't include it.
